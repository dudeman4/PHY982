abstract="The interaction between deuterons and 58, 62Ni nuclei at energies of E                d = 3.5, 4.5 and 5.16 MeV is investigated. The discrepancy between measured scattering elastic cross section and the Rutherford ones is higher than the value calculated theoretically by considering deuterons polarization and Coulomb breakup. Analysis of measured cross section of 58, 62Ni(d, p) reaction and the results of calculation of Coulomb breakup cross section integrated over neutron emission angles shows that that the dominant mechanism of proton formation is the reaction of neutron transfer to the target nucleus.",
