abstract = "Angular distributions of the cross sections and analyzing powers were measured for the 58Ni(d,p)59Ni reaction up to the excitation energy of 10 MeV in 59Ni with a high-resolution polarized deuteron beam at 56 MeV. Spins and parities were assigned for 33 discrete levels up to the excitation energy of 8 MeV. Spectroscopic factors, single-particle energies and spreading widths of 1f52, 2p32, 2p12, 1g92 states were obtained. Neutron-bound-state complex potentials have been calculated from the resultant spreading widths and energies together with results from other one-nucleon transfer-reaction experiments on nickel and calcium isotopes. It is found that the energy dependence of the spreading widths of the single-particle and -hole states and then the imaginary parts of the bound-state potentials in the excitation energy region of 0â€“10 MeV show a symmetrical behavior with respect to the Fermi surface."
