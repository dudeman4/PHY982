$^{11}$Be has 4 protons and 7 neutrons. According to the shell model, we would expect 2 neutrons in a $1s_{1/2}$ state, 4 in $1p_{3/2}$ the 7$^{th}$ electron in a $1p_{1/2}$ state; however, experimentally we find that the ground state of $^{11}$Be is a $2s_{1/2}$ state, which is certainly related to the fact that $^{11}$Be is a halo nucleus and not a truly bound state $\leftarrow$ \textit{\textbf{Is it correct to say that halo nuclei are not "truly bound"? And is this a sufficient answer?}}

Slightly above the ground state in energy we find a $1/2^-$
